# Whitelist-Taskkiller
A simple windows Taskkiller which is working with a whitelist so it wont kill your whitelisted applications

Info: \n
to make sure the programm does his job well, do not rename any of the files.

Whitelist usage:
  <process> <process> <process>
    without any newlines and one whitespace after each name of process

Example:
explorer spotify chrome

when you are done with your whitelist just simple execute the Taskkiller.exe 


for self building:
gcc main.c -o Taskkiller.exe

hope you enjoy :)
