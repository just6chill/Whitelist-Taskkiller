# Whitelist-Taskkiller
A simple windows Taskkiller which is working with a whitelist so it wont kill your whitelisted applications


Info: 

to make sure the programm does his job well, do not rename any of the files.


Whitelist usage:

    <process> <process> <process>
  
  without any newlines and one whitespace after each name of process
  


Example:

    explorer spotify chrome
    

when you are done with your whitelist just simple execute the Taskkiller.exe 



for self building:

    gcc main.c -o Taskkiller.exe
